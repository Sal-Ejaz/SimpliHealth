/* We receive the user's input as a string in the POST request.
 We pass this string to the `processHealthInput` function, which uses Gemini to extract the required information.
 Gemini parses the input and returns a JSON object with age, location, and symptom.
 We destructure this object to store these values as separate variables.
 We then use these stored variables in subsequent function calls to fetch clinical trials and generate health advice.
 Finally, we return all of this information, including the extracted variables, in our API response.
This approach allows us to effectively use Gemini for natural language processing, extracting structured data from unstructured text input. 
The extracted variables are then available for use throughout the rest of our application logic.

    Conversation history:

    Format the response as follows:

    General Advice:
    [List general advice here, each point starting with "->"]

    CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Do not use any asterisks (*) or any symbols besides periods (.) and the arrow symbol (->).
    2. For all bullet points and listing details, use only the arrow symbol "->".
    3. Do not attempt to make any text bold or emphasized. Use plain text only.
    4. Start each piece of advice or detail with "->", followed by a space, then the text.
    5. Do not use any markdown or other formatting syntax.
    
    Example format:
    General Advice:
    -> Advice point 1
    -> Advice point 2
    
    [Symptom]:
    -> Specific advice 1
    -> Specific advice 2
    
    When to Seek Medical Help:
    -> Situation 1
    -> Situation 2
